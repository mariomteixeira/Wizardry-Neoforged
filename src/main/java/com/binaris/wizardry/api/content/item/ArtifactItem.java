/**
 * Base class for artifact items. Artifacts are special items that provide passive effects when being on the player's
 * hotbar or in an accessory (check {@code AccessoriesArtifactItem} in the Accessories integration module).
 * <p>
 * Artifacts can have an associated {@link IArtifactEffect} which defines what effects they provide. These effects
 * are triggered by various events, such as ticking, the player being hurt, or spell casting. Static methods are provided
 * to handle these events and apply the effects of all equipped artifacts. These effects are optional; an artifact can
 * be created without one.
