/**
 * Represents the data associated with a minion entity in the game. A minion is a mob that is summoned from any spell or
 * ability related to minions. In order to create a very quick and easy implementation of a minion we use this interface
 * to store all the necessary data and functionality related to minions, this goes such as lifetime, ownership, and any
 * needed parts to remove from the original mob's goals and add the minion specific ones.
 * <p>
 * You don't need to implement this interface yourself, as the mod provides default implementations for all mobs that
 * are designated as minions. Instead, you can use {@link MinionSpell MinionSpell}
 * and related classes to summon and manage minions without worrying about the underlying data handling.
